The patcher now supports every scenario including gstreamer (credits to @nap-liu).

A new version of the wrapper was deployed (v2.1).
You can find the changelog here: https://github.com/AlexPresso/VideoStation-FFMPEG-Patcher/releases/tag/2.1

As always, please let me know of any issue you could have.
